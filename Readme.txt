1. Very important !! There is method that delete all your downloads from chrome folder.
2. One test is failing - there is no search phrase 'There is Safety in Numbers'
3. When I searched for 'gartner' I discovered that first results is Lorem ipsum - test content on production
4. I could not try run tests on IE, I implement IE driver but I don't know if working corectly.
5. I had issues with proxy and github but I think resolve it.
6. I use specflow. Gherkin language itself is doing some kind of 'Logging' but I implemented Log4N.
7. If something is not working please feel free to contact me.
8. I spend about 8-9 hours on that project (from scratches including all package instalation, only VS was already installed).
9. I divide scenarios because they were not strongly connected. Another reason -> 2. there is no phrase 'There is Safety in Numbers' so test is failing on that one. So next steps aren't executed.
10. I count that regardless of interview process someone will spend some time and do a code review and tell me what should I improve.

Thanks and Best Regards,
